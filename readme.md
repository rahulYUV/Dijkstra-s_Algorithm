Shortest Path Finder Using Dijkstra's Algorithm

ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This project implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted, undirected graph. It allows users to input a start and end node, calculates the shortest path, and displays the total distance. A predefined graph with nodes A to F is visualized for user reference.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between two nodes.
Input Validation: Ensures that user inputs are valid and correspond to nodes in the graph.
Graph Visualization: A predefined graph is displayed for easy reference to understand node connections.
Interactive: Users can continue finding paths between different nodes or exit the program.
Path Reconstruction: Reconstructs the entire path from the start to destination, displaying all intermediate nodes.
